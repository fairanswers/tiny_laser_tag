Project for research on the attiny85 laser tag

This project came about when I was researching Arduino.  I wanted a simple but handy thing to build towards while I learned the language and toolchain.

This will program an arduino at tiny 85 (http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATtiny85) low-cost microcontroller and use it to send and receive IR signals, like with a lazer tag game.

The code works with inexpensive IR parts similar to the ones available at Radio Shack, but they are much less expensive on eBay.

I removed the earlier and non-working examples and left the final product.
